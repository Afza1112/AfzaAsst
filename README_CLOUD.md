## 🚀 **Performance Benchmarks:**

| Feature | Local | Cloud | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|-------|
| AI Chat | ⚡ Fast | ⚡ Fast | DialoGPT-medium |
| Code Gen | ⚡ Fast | ⚡ Fast | Same as chat |
| Image Gen | 🐌 30s | 🐌 60-120s | CPU-only on cloud |
| Voice STT | ⚡ Fast | ⚡ Fast | Whisper base model |
| Text-to-Speech | ⚡ Fast | ⚡ Fast | Google TTS |

## 🔒 **Privacy & Security:**

- **No External APIs**: All processing happens locally/on cloud
- **No Data Collection**: Chat history stays in session
- **Secure Upload**: Audio files processed locally
- **Open Source**: Full code transparency

## 🛠️ **Troubleshooting:**

### **Common Issues:**

1. **Model Loading Slow:**
   - First load takes time (downloading models)
   - Subsequent loads are cached

2. **Image Generation Fails:**
   - Check memory usage
   - Try smaller image sizes
   - Restart app if needed

3. **Voice Upload Issues:**
   - Supported formats: WAV, MP3, M4A, OGG
   - Max file size: 200MB
   - Clear audio works best

### **Dependency Issues:**
```bash
# If dependencies fail to install
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements_final.txt
```

## 📈 **Future Enhancements:**

- [ ] API key support for premium models
- [ ] Batch image generation
- [ ] Custom model fine-tuning
- [ ] Advanced voice features
- [ ] Multi-language support
