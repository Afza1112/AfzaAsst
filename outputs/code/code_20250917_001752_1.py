To create a basic but well-structured React component using TypeScript, one can leverage the features of both languages to ensure type safety and maintainable code structure while implementing good coding standards such as linting configurations (e.g., ESLint with Airbnb or Prettier), test coverage goals (using Jest), and documentation practices (with tools like React Docgen). Below is an example of a simple, reusable `Welcome` component that includes prop validation, error handling for missing props using the PropTypes library as it's commonly used in conjunction with TypeScript to provide runtime checks before compiling down to JavaScript.

Firstly, ensure you have created your React application scaffolded with TypeScript support:
```sh
npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript
cd my intermediate/dir
npm install prop-types@15 -D // PropTypes is used for runtime checks prior to compiling down in production. In a final, compiled app, you should replace this with Type Guards / Type Assertions provided by the compiler and JSDoc comments or TS types instead of PropTypes as they compile directly into JavaScript without any overhead:
``` 

Here's how your component might look like using both JSX syntax within React components and ES6+ features alongside strong type checking from TypeScript. Note that prop-types are primarily used during development to catch bugs, but in a production build you would want PropTypes removed as they do not exist at runtime:
```tsx
import * as React from 'react';
import PropTypes from 'prop-types'; // For the purpose of this example; remove for final compiled version.

interface WelcomeProps {
  name?: string;
}

const greeting = (props: WelcomeProps) => <p>Welcome, {props.name || "Guest"}!</p>;

export default function Welcome(props: WelcomeProps) {
  if (!props.name && !process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') { // Basic error handling to prevent showing welcome message without a name in production environment for performance reasons.
    throw new Error("Welcome requires the 'name' prop.");
  }

  return greeting(props);
}

// PropTypes (Should be removed after compiling down during development) - Use Type Checks Instead:
/** @jsxImportSource @emotion/react */
import EmbeddedHTML from '@emotion/react';
export const WelcomeComponent = React.memo((propProps) => {
  return <greeting name={propProps.name} />; // This will be replaced with the actual memoized component code after TypeScript compilation during development stage or directly in production, without PropTypes and using type guards/assertions for added safety:
});

WelcomeComponent.displayName = 'Welcome';
``` 
To compile your TypeScript React components into JavaScript, run `npm start` if you're developing the app locally to see changes immediately within a browser or use build tools like Webpack with Babel and ts-loader for transpiling/type checking before bundling. Remember not to include PropTypes in production builds as they are only used at runtime during development phases, but TypeScript itself along with its compiler should be enough to catch most errors related to props passed down through the hierarchy of components when compiling your code into JavaScript which is then run on any standard browser environment that supports ES6+ features.

If using a modern setup like Create React App (CRA) or Next.js, you may choose not to include PropTypes in production directly since these frameworks come with their own mechanisms for handling prop validation and linting best practices out of the box which should also be followed as per project documentation.
