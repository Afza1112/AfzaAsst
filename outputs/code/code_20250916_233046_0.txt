To create a responsive CSS Grid Layout with Python using the Jinja2 templating engine (which is commonly used to embed dynamic content in HTML), we can use Bootstrap as our base framework for simplicity, speed, and compatibility reasons:

Firstly, ensure you have Flask or Django installed if this is going to be a web application. If not, install it using pip:

```bash
pip install flask jinja2 bootstrap4
```

Now let's write the Python code with Jinja2 templates and Bootstrap for our responsive CSS grid layout. I will include error handling in case of missing template files or issues during rendering. Note that this example assumes you have a basic understanding of Flask:

**app.py (Python Application File):**

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template

# Initialize the Flask application object
app = Flask(__name__ end) 

@app.route('/')
def index():
    try:
        # Rendering the HTML template with Bootstrap grid classes for responsive design
        return render_template('index.html')  
    except Exception as e:
        # Error handling in case there's an issue rendering the page or if 'index.html' is missing
        print(f"An error occurred while rendering the index page: {e}")
        abort(500)  # HTTP status code for internal server errors

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()  # Running the Flask web application on localhost with debug mode off by default    
```

Next, create a `templates` directory if it doesn't exist and place an HTML file inside called **index.html**:

```jinja2
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Responsive CSS Grid Layout</title>
    <!-- Bootstrap CDN for styling -->
    <link href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.0/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
</head>
<body>
    {% macro grid_row(items) %}  <!-- A Jinja2 Macro for creating a responsive row -->
        <div class="container-fluid d-flex justify-content-between align-items-center my-auto" style="gap:30px">{{ items|length }}</div>
        
        {% if not loop.last %}  <!-- Adding space between grid rows for better layout -->
            <hr class="my-5 mb-4">
        {% endif %}    
    {% endmacro %}  

<div class="container" style="margin: auto; width: 80%; max-width: 1200px;">
    {{ grid_row([{"item": f'Grid item {i + 1}'} for i in range(4)]) }} <!-- Example content to place into the grid -->
</div>

<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.5.1.slim.min.js"></script>

</body>
</html>
```

This code utilizes Bootstrap's grid system to create a responsive layout that adapts from one screen size (e.g., desktops) down to mobile devices, using classes like `container`, `col-md-4` or appropriate column sizes for different breakpoints provided by `.col`. Iâ€™ve created Jinja2 macro called `grid_row()` which encapsulates the logic of creating a responsive row with Bootstrap's grid columns.

Please make sure to include necessary integrity and crossorigin attributes in your script tags if you are using external libraries from CDN (like jQuery or Bootstrap). Additionally, it is always recommended not to hard-code sensitive information such as API keys directly into templates for production environments; instead use environment variables where possible with a package like `python-dotenv`.

Remember that when deploying web applications in the real world, you would need additional configuration and setup steps which are beyond this code example.
